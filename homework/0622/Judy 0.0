Object Oriented Programming

OOP is based on concept of "object".
The object is an instance of a class.
The class can contain data properties and code(procedure).
Procedures of an object can access and modify its data properties.

OOP has below main concepts
1. Encapsulation
  data can have restriction to hide itself from outside and only allow access from methods from the save class.
  in Java, private data is only visible to methods inside of same class, protected data is only visible to classes in the same package.
2. Composition, inheritance, and delegation
 a. Objects can contain other objects in their instance variables, aka "has-a"
 b. Inheritance, aka "is-a", means child class can inherit fields and methods from parent class, and can also overwrite the methods from parent class.
 c. Interface and abstract class are used to create a protocal for classes inherit/extend from them, and also encapsule concrete fields from outside
3. Polymorphism
  classes inherit from same class/interface can have different behaviors, like Cat and Dog inherits from Animal but they are different animals.
